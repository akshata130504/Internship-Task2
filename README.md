# 📘 Java Developer Internship – Task 2  
## Variables, Data Types & Console Input Application

---

## 📌 Task Objective
The objective of this task is to understand Java primitive data types, variable scope, console input handling, arithmetic operations, type casting, and formatted output by building an interactive console-based calculator.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **IDE:** Eclipse  
- **Language:** Java  
- **JDK Version:** Java 17 / Java 21 (Eclipse Adoptium)

## 🧩 Features Implemented
- Declaration of **all Java primitive data types** with memory explanation
- Demonstration of **local, instance, and static variables**
- Console input using **Scanner**
- Arithmetic operations: `+  -  *  /`
- **Division-by-zero** and invalid operator handling
- **Type casting**
  - Implicit casting (int → double)
  - Explicit casting (double → int)
- Formatted output using **System.out.printf**
- Clean and well-commented source code

---

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run
  Open Command Prompt / Terminal in the `src` directory and run:

     ```bash
     javac CalculatorDemo.java
     java CalculatorDemo



## Sample Console Output

=== Console Calculator ===
Enter first number: 3

Enter second number: 4

Choose operation (+ - * /): +

Result: 3.00 + 4.00 = 7.00

Type Casting Examples:

Double to int: 99

Int to double: 1000.0


## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understood primitive vs non-primitive data types

Learned variable scope (local, instance, static)

Gained hands-on experience with Scanner input

Implemented arithmetic operations with validation

Learned implicit and explicit type casting

Used formatted output for professional console display

Improved Java coding standards and project structure
